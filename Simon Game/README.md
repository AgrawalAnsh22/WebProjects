# SIMON GAME

The web-app is made by implementing the javascript event handling functions.

### Gameplay

The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed. 
A round in the game consists of the board lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. 
As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. 

Simon is named after the simple children's game of Simon Says, but the gameplay is based on Atari's unpopular Touch Me arcade game from 1974. 
Simon differs from Touch Me in that the Touch Me buttons were all of the same color (black) and the sounds it produced were harsh and grating.
